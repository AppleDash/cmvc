cmvc
====

This is a CGI site in C that will eventually become an MVC framework thing.

This now depends on adlib... Which isn't yet publicly available. It will be soon, though!

`cmvc.cgi` is the main CGI script that recompiles and runs the C code for each request.

Note that the code in this is absolutely terrible, and is not intended to be anything but. If you'd like an example of the developer's programming skills, please look elsewhere.
